    <h1>Burger</h1>
    <p class="description">
        This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.

        Making an Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger is incredibly simple—especially if you follow Sarah’s Oklahoma Onion Burger recipe from Allrecipes. You’ll just need the ground meat of your choice (seasoned to your liking), onions that are thinly sliced (almost translucent), and your burger bun of choice. You can add additional toppings, if you like, like cheese, condiments, pickles, or veggies.

To make the burger, scoop a ball of hamburger meat onto a hot skillet or outdoor grill. Then top the ball with a heaping pile of sliced onions. Smash the burger down with a spatula, then let the burger cook on both sides (carefully flipping the burger to keep the onions in place). If you’re adding cheese, add it to the side without the onions so they have more time to cook and caramelize.
