    <p class="description">The Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger is one of the “oldest, classic burgers in the world,” according to Cailan. It was created in Oklahoma (obviously) during the Great Depression when meat was expensive but onions were cheap—so making smash burgers meant they could use less of the expensive meat and more of the cheap veggie.

    <b>Directions:</b>
</br>
    Making an Oklahoma Fried Onion Burger is incredibly simple—especially if you follow Sarah’s Oklahoma Onion Burger recipe from Allrecipes. You’ll just need the ground meat of your choice (seasoned to your liking), onions that are thinly sliced (almost translucent), and your burger bun of choice. You can add additional toppings, if you like, like cheese, condiments, pickles, or veggies.
    <ol>
        <li>To make the burger, scoop a ball of hamburger meat onto a hot skillet or outdoor grill</li>
        <li>Then top the ball with a heaping pile of sliced onions</li>
        <li>Smash the burger down with a spatula, then let the burger cook on both sides (carefully flipping the burger to keep the onions in place)</li>
        <li>If you’re adding cheese, add it to the side without the onions so they have more time to cook and caramelize.</li>
    </ol>
