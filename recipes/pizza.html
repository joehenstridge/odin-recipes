    <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <p class="description">
        This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    PIZZA DOUGH:
Olive oil (for pan, dough and stretching)
2 1/4 (270 grams) cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon Fleischmann's RapidRise ® Yeast
3/4 (6 ounces) cups warm water
TOPPING:
3 ounces aged provolone cubed
8 ounces shredded mozzarella
1/2 cup pizza sauce
5 ounces pepperoni cups

<p>
    In a large bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, kosher salt and Fleischmann’s RapidRise ® Yeast
Then pour in the warm water (100 degrees F) and olive oil. Mix it together until combined.
Pour a few tablespoons of olive oil in a 9×13-inch baking pan and spread it around. Add the dough to the center.
Using your fingers, press dimples into the dough. We’re going to allow the crust to relax and then slowly push it into toward the corners. Set your timer for 15 minutes and cover the dough with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. This should be rising in a warm place in your home. Not drafty!
At the 15-minute mark, return back to the dough, and press it using your fingers, working it closer to the edge of the pan but not all the way. Set your timer again for 15 minutes and cover it once more.
 At the 15 minute mark, return back to the dough, and press it, using our fingers, until the dough reaches the edges and the corners.
Cover it and allow to rise for 1 full hour. At the 1-hour mark, spread the sauce on top in one even, thin layer. Top it with the two cheeses and place a blanket of pepperoni cups. Pepperoni cups will shrivel up and shrink so it’s important to put a good amount.
Transfer to the oven to bake for 7 minutes, rotate it at the 7-minute mark to ensure even baking and then bake for an additional 7 minutes.
Remove from the oven. Allow to cool for a few minutes and then slide it onto a large cutting board.
